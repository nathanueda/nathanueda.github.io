## Projects
1. [Quantitative Momentum Strategy](https://github.com/nathanueda/Algorithmic-Trading-in-Python/blob/main/002_quantitative_momentum_strategy.ipynb) (Python)
* Through utilizing batch API calls and various Python libraries (such as NumPy and pandas) the program selects a list of the 50 highest quality momentum stocks based on various metrics such as varying time length price returns.
* The program calculates the number of shares to buy based on a user-defined portfolio amount. 
* Exports the results to a neatly formatted excel document.

2. [Ice Man](https://github.com/nathanueda/IceMan) (C++)                    
* Developed and designed a game with a graphical user interface.
* Implemented the programming via pair programming with an object-oriented approach. 
* Utilized inheritance, breadth first search algorithms, as well as modern C++ features such as smart pointers.
  
3. [Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund](https://github.com/nathanueda/Algorithmic-Trading-in-Python/blob/main/001_equal_weight_S%26P_500.ipynb) (Python)                       
* Through utilizing batch API calls and various Python libraries (such as NumPy and pandas) the program calculates the number of shares to buy based on a user-defined portfolio value of each S&P 500 constituent to get an equal-weighted version of the index fund. 
* Exports the results to a neatly formatted excel document.
